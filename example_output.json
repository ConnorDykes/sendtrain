    "programDescripton": "This 16-week program is designed for an elite sport climber aiming to push their redpoint grade. It follows a periodized structure, starting with a foundation of strength and power, transitioning into sport-specific power-endurance, and culminating in a performance phase dedicated to redpointing a goal project. The program is built for 3-4 sessions per week to accommodate a busy schedule, emphasizing high-quality, focused training over sheer volume.",
    "programNotes": {
      "safetyDisclaimer": "Always consult with a healthcare professional before beginning any new training program. The loads and intensities described are for an elite-level athlete and should be adjusted based on your body's feedback. Pay close attention to your fingers, elbows, and shoulders. Do not train through sharp or persistent pain.",
      "injuryModifications": "No injuries were reported. However, given the high intensity of this program, it is crucial to proactively manage recovery and listen to your body. If pain develops, especially in soft tissues, reduce intensity, take extra rest, and consult a qualified physical therapist.",
      "assumptionsMade": "This program assumes you have access to a commercial climbing gym with extensive bouldering, sport climbing routes, a spray wall, a fingerboard, and a standard set of strength training equipment (e.g., free weights, pull-up bars). It also assumes that due to your stated time constraints (family and full-time job), each session should be highly focused and completed within approximately 2-2.5 hours. The weekly schedule is a template (Mon/Wed/Fri); adjust the days to fit your personal schedule, but ensure at least one full rest day between high-intensity sessions."
